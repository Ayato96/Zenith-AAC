Zenith AAC
==========

What is Zenith?
---------------
Zenith AAC is a powerful and flexible automated account creator (AAC) for OpenTibia servers. Zenith aims to be as easy as possible both to develop, by using the expressive and elegant framework [Laravel](http://laravel.com), and for the user (player) to access and understand resources. Zenith combines the very best features of what we see in other AACs, such as Modern, Znote and Harveu, and provides the powerful tools needed for every OT server along with flexibility needed to customise for your own server.

Zenith philosophies
-------------------
With Zenith, the server administrator should have the least possible hassle with configuration. Zenith should be easily configurable to its core function and require minimal external tweaking, such as messing with command line and database handling tools. Everything should be accessible from just inside the efficient administration panel, fully integrated with OpenTibia API. Zenith follows [GoodUI](http://goodui.org) ideas, especially when it comes to user easy of use.

Zenith was built from scratch to be a masterpiece. To contain kludges is an abominable workaround, since we are pursing real solutions for real problems. 

Features
--------
When Zenith is out of development versions and is published as ready for use, the following features will be available:

- Account and character management integrated with OpenTibia default database schema - that means no extra tables with very few new columns ![done](http://i.imgur.com/tduiZBL.png)
- Article and newsticker systems with an easy to use WYSIWYG editor (yet to be chosen or developed) ![working](http://i.imgur.com/ivaAcM7.png)
- Comprehensive community pages, such as highscores, who is online and kill statistics ![done](http://i.imgur.com/tduiZBL.png)
- Complete out-of-the-box management for houses and guilds (player-side and administrator-side) ![working](http://i.imgur.com/ivaAcM7.png)
- Administration dashboard with easy and advanced server management tools
- Simple plugin and assets system, with installation and configuration like Wordpress.

Architecture
------------
Zenith is built on the solid Laravel framework, which itself is built with PHP. You will need a webserver such as [Nginx](http://nginx.org) and the PHP interpreter (or the [HHVM](http://hhvm.com)) to run them properly. It is also recommended that you have Git installed to keep your Zenith installation on the bleeding edge by pulling it regularly from the repositories.

Licensing
---------
Zenith is released under the MIT License. It means you may do anything you want with the code, as long as you provide attribution back to me and do not hold me liable. Also, consider you owe me a beer or a coffee if you really like Zenith and meet me personally. :)
